# Monorepo Roadmap Synthesis

Using the monorepo discovery context, generate a unified Interverse roadmap that aggregates across all modules.

## Preferred Output Pair

- `docs/roadmap.md` (human-readable)
- `docs/roadmap.json` (machine-readable canonical output, source-of-truth)

## Canonical JSON generation (required)

Run the monorepo rollup generator before markdown synthesis:

```bash
ROOT_DIR="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd)"
ROADMAP_SYNC="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/sync-roadmap-json.sh"
if [ -z "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}" ] || [ ! -x "$ROADMAP_SYNC" ]; then
    ROADMAP_SYNC="$ROOT_DIR/plugins/interpath/scripts/sync-roadmap-json.sh"
fi
if [ ! -x "$ROADMAP_SYNC" ]; then
    echo "Could not find interpath roadmap sync wrapper" >&2
    exit 1
fi
"$ROADMAP_SYNC"
```

Then load and use that JSON as your authoritative roadmap input. If generation fails, continue with discovered context but mark outputs as degraded.

## Output Structure

### Header

```markdown
# Interverse Roadmap

**Modules:** [count] | **Open beads:** [count] | **Last updated:** [today's date]
**Structure:** [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)
```

### Section 1: Ecosystem Snapshot

A table of all modules with their current state:

```markdown
## Ecosystem Snapshot

| Module | Location | Version | Status | Roadmap | Open Beads |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| clavain | hub/clavain | X.Y.Z | active | yes | N |
| interflux | plugins/interflux | X.Y.Z | active | yes | N |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

**Status** values:
- `active` — has recent commits and/or open beads
- `stable` — no recent activity, appears complete
- `early` — has manifest but limited development
- `planned` — referenced in docs but no manifest

### Section 2: Roadmap — Now / Next / Later

Aggregate from monorepo beads, organized by priority:

```markdown
## Roadmap

### Now (P0–P1)
- [module] **beads-xxx** Description of critical/high-priority item
- [module] **beads-yyy** Description (blocked by beads-zzz)

### Next (P2)
- [module] **beads-xxx** Description of medium-priority item

### Later (P3–P4)
- [module] **beads-xxx** Description of backlog/aspirational item
```

For each item:
- Tag with `[module]` prefix identifying which module it relates to
- Include bead ID for traceability
- Note blocking relationships inline
- Items that span multiple modules get tagged with all relevant modules

Roll-up inclusion rules:
- Start from all modules' roadmap artifacts.
- Prefer `docs/roadmap.json` as the source per module when present.
- Fallback to `docs/roadmap.md` parsing only when JSON is missing.
- Deduplicate by `(id, module)` pair.
- Add monorepo-level items if they are in open beads even when they are not present in module-level artifacts.

### Section 3: Module Highlights

For each module that has either `docs/roadmap.json` or `docs/roadmap.md`, provide a 2-3 line summary of current focus:

```markdown
## Module Highlights

### clavain (hub/clavain)
Current focus: [synthesized from roadmap]. Key items: [2-3 highlights].

### interflux (plugins/interflux)
Current focus: [synthesized from roadmap]. Key items: [2-3 highlights].
```

For consistency, prefer `docs/roadmap.json` module summary fields when available and fallback to markdown-derived summary.

### Section 4: Research Agenda

Synthesize from monorepo-level brainstorms, PRDs, plans, and roadmap artifacts.

```markdown
## Research Agenda

- **[topic]** — [1-line summary from brainstorm/plan] ([source file])
- **[topic]** — [1-line summary] ([source file])
```

### Section 5: Cross-Module Dependencies

Blocking relationships between beads, especially those spanning modules:

```markdown
## Cross-Module Dependencies

- **beads-xxx** (interlock) blocks **beads-yyy** (clavain) — [reason]
- **beads-aaa** (intermute) blocks **beads-bbb** (interlock) — [reason]
```

If no cross-module blocking exists, note "No cross-module blockers identified."

### Section 6: Modules Without Roadmaps

List modules that lack both `docs/roadmap.json` and `docs/roadmap.md`, with their bead count:

```markdown
## Modules Without Roadmaps

| Module | Location | Open Beads | Notes |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| interline | plugins/interline | 0 | statusline renderer |
| interwatch | plugins/interwatch | 2 | doc freshness monitoring |
```

### Section 7: Keeping Current

```markdown
## Keeping Current

```
# Regenerate this roadmap
/interpath:roadmap    (from Interverse root)

# Propagate items to subrepo roadmaps
/interpath:propagate  (from Interverse root)
```
```

### Canonical machine output: `docs/roadmap.json`

Emit a stable JSON artifact that captures the complete roll-up. Prefer the file generated by:

```bash
"$ROADMAP_SYNC"
```

Expected fields:

```json
{
  "project": "Interverse",
  "kind": "interverse-monorepo-roadmap",
  "generated_at": "<ISO-8601>",
  "module_count": 25,
  "open_beads": 0,
  "blocked": 0,
  "modules": [],
  "snapshot": [
    {
      "module": "clavain",
      "location": "hub/clavain",
      "version": "0.6.26",
      "status": "active",
      "has_roadmap": true,
      "roadmap_source": "json|markdown|none",
      "open_beads": 0
    }
  ],
  "roadmap": {
    "now": [],
    "next": [],
    "later": []
  },
  "module_highlights": [],
  "research_agenda": [],
  "cross_module_dependencies": [],
  "modules_without_roadmaps": []
}
```

Use module-level roadmap item shape for arrays:

```json
{
  "id": "iv-xxxx",
  "module": "interflux",
  "title": "Item title",
  "phase": "now|next|later",
  "priority": "P0|P1|P2|P3|P4",
  "status": "open|blocked|in_progress",
  "blocked_by": ["iv-aaaa"],
  "source": "beads|module-roadmap|monorepo-beads|research",
  "source_file": "docs/roadmap.md"
}
```

This JSON artifact is the source-of-truth for cross-repo tooling and should be treated as definitive for roll-up behavior.

## Writing Guidelines

- Be factual — use counts, versions, and bead IDs, not qualitative claims
- Tag every item with its module so readers can filter mentally
- Keep each item to 1-2 lines
- Link to source files where possible
- Target 200-400 lines (larger than single-project due to scope)
- Sections for which no data is available should say "No data available" rather than being omitted
- Sort modules alphabetically within tables
