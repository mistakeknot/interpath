# interpath — Development Guide

## Architecture

interpath is a product artifact generator for Claude Code. It synthesizes project documentation from multiple sources:

- **Beads** — issue tracker state (open/closed/blocked counts, priorities)
- **Brainstorms** — design explorations in `docs/brainstorms/`
- **Plans** — implementation plans in `docs/plans/`
- **Flux-drive summaries** — review outputs in `docs/research/flux-drive/`
- **Plugin manifests** — version and component counts from `plugin.json`
- **Git history** — recent commits, tags, activity patterns

### Skill: artifact-gen

The single skill routes to artifact-specific phases:

```
SKILL.md (router)
  → phases/discover.md  (shared source discovery)
  → phases/roadmap.md   (roadmap synthesis)
  → phases/prd.md       (PRD synthesis)
  → phases/vision.md    (vision doc synthesis)
  → phases/changelog.md (changelog synthesis)
  → phases/status.md    (status report synthesis)
```

### References

- `references/source-catalog.md` — discoverable source types with glob patterns
- `references/output-templates.md` — structural templates per artifact type

## Component Conventions

### Skills

- One skill directory: `skills/artifact-gen/`
- SKILL.md has YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- Phase files in `phases/` subdirectory
- Reference files in `references/` subdirectory

### Commands

- 5 commands in `commands/`: roadmap.md, prd.md, vision.md, changelog.md, status.md
- Each has YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- Each invokes the `artifact-gen` skill with the artifact type

## Testing

```bash
cd /root/projects/Interverse/plugins/interpath
uv run pytest tests/structural/ -v
```

### Test Categories

- **test_structure.py** — plugin.json validity, directory structure, marker file
- **test_skills.py** — skill count, frontmatter, phase files, reference files
- **test_commands.py** — command count, frontmatter, expected commands exist

## Development Workflow

1. Edit skill/command files
2. Run structural tests: `uv run pytest tests/structural/ -v`
3. Test locally: `claude --plugin-dir /root/projects/Interverse/plugins/interpath`
4. Bump version and publish: `scripts/bump-version.sh <version>`
